# Biased Dice Roll Simulation

This project simulates a biased dice roll using Python. The number 6 has a higher chance of being rolled compared to the other numbers (1 to 5).

## How it Works

- The dice has numbers from 1 to 6.
- The dice roll is biased, meaning that the number 6 has a higher probability of being rolled.
- The bias is achieved using `random.choices()` with weights assigned to each number.
